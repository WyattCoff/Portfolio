		Jimmy Carr's early career began in the early 2000s when he started performing stand-up comedy in London clubs. He quickly gained a reputation for his distinctive style of dark humor and deadpan delivery. Carr's breakthrough came in 2002 when he won the "City Life Best Newcomer Award" at the Manchester Comedy Festival. This led to his first appearance at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival the following year, where he received critical acclaim and quickly established himself as a rising star on the UK comedy circuit. Carr's early comedy routines often centered around his observations of everyday life and his acerbic wit. He became known for his razor-sharp one-liners and often controversial jokes that pushed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable comedy. In 2003, Carr made his first television appearance on the show "The Comedy Store" and went on to appear on several other TV shows, including "8 Out of 10 Cats" and "The Big Fat Quiz of the Year". Despite facing criticism for his provocative material, Carr's popularity continued to grow, and he became a regular fixture on the UK comedy scene, performing at various festivals and comedy clubs around the country.
